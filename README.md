This repository contains a parser for Wwise soundbank XML files implemented in multiple programming languages. The parser extracts various data from the XML file, such as event IDs and names, RTPC IDs and names, switch IDs and names, state IDs and names, and auxbus IDs and names.

Features:
- Retrieves event IDs and names.
- Retrieves RTPC IDs and names.
- Retrieves switch IDs and names.
- Retrieves state IDs and names.
- Retrieves auxbus IDs and names.

Usage:
1. Select the desired programming language folder.
2. Use the provided code as a starting point to integrate the Wwise soundbank XML parser into your project.
3. Customize the code to fit your specific requirements.
4. Fetch the desired data from the XML file using the provided functions.

Contributions:
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have improvements or additional features to add, feel free to submit a pull request.

License:
This code is provided under the MIT License. You can freely use, modify, and distribute the code. See the LICENSE file for more details.

Note:
The parser relies on the structure and formatting of the Wwise soundbank XML file generated by Wwise. Make sure the XML file follows the expected format to ensure accurate parsing.

## Overview

Wwise Soundbank XML files are structured to capture and describe the audio assets, events, and interactive behaviors within a Wwise project. The elements and structure enable seamless integration of audio content into the game engine or interactive application, providing control and flexibility for creating immersive and interactive audio experiences.
These files are generated by Audiokinetic's Wwise software, which is a popular audio middleware solution used in the gaming and interactive media industry. They contain structured data that describes various audio assets, events, and metadata associated with audio content in a Wwise project. 

Wwise Soundbank XML files serve as a bridge between the audio assets and the game engine or playback system. They provide a structured representation of audio content and its associated metadata, enabling integration and playback control within a game or interactive application. Here are some key aspects of Wwise Soundbank XML files:
 - File Structure: The XML file follows a hierarchical structure, representing different elements and their relationships within the Wwise project. The root element typically contains information about the soundbank itself, such as its name, version, and platform compatibility.
 - Sound Objects: The XML file defines sound objects, which can include audio assets such as audio files, MIDI files, or generated sounds. Each sound object has a unique ID and is associated with various properties, such as its name, duration, and playback settings.
 - Events: Events represent the triggering mechanisms within Wwise. They define how sounds are played in response to game events or user interactions. Events may be associated with specific sound objects or contain references to other events, allowing for complex audio behaviors.
 - Hierarchy and Relationships: The XML file maintains the hierarchy of sound objects and events, representing the organization and structure of audio assets within the project. Elements can be nested within each other to create parent-child relationships.
 - Properties and Parameters: Sound objects and events can have properties and parameters that define various characteristics, such as volume, pitch, spatial positioning, and effects. These properties can be adjusted and controlled dynamically during runtime to create dynamic and interactive audio experiences.
 - Platforms and Platforms Data: The XML file includes platform-specific information and settings, allowing for soundbank generation and optimization for different target platforms and devices.

It's important to note that the specific structure and elements within the XML file may vary depending on the Wwise version, project settings, and the complexity of the audio content.

## Wwise Soundbank XML Nodes

| Element                             | Description                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SoundBankInfo                       | Provides general information about the soundbank, such as its name, short name, and version.                      |
| Sound Objects                       | Represents individual audio assets within the soundbank, including waveform files, MIDI files, etc.               |
| Events                              | Defines triggering mechanisms for playing sounds in response to specific events or game actions.                  |
| Actions                             | Defines specific actions or behaviors associated with an event, such as playing a sound or modifying properties.  |
| Switches and States                 | Control variations of sounds played within an event based on defined switch groups or state groups.               |
| RTPC (Real-Time Parameter Control)  | Allows for real-time control of sound properties during gameplay through dynamic parameter adjustment.            |
| Platform-Specific Information       | Includes platform-specific data and settings for platform optimizations and compatibility.                        |
| Auxiliary Sends and Buses           | Define the routing and mixing of sounds, including effects processing and global control.                         |
| External Sources                    | Represents audio files or streams not directly managed by Wwise but referenced within the soundbank.              |
